# Design Principles

> **Note**: This page is under construction and will be available in a future release.

## Overview

JD.Domain is built on three core design principles:

1. **Opt-in**: Features are explicit and composable
2. **Modular**: Use only what you need
3. **Deterministic**: Predictable, testable behavior

## Coming Soon

- Detailed explanation of each principle
- Code examples demonstrating the principles
- Best practices and patterns

For now, see the [Quick Start Guide](~/docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) for practical examples.
